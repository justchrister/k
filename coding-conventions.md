# Coding Conventions

Our coding conventions follow a consistent naming scheme to improve code readability and maintainability. All variable names and component names are written in camelCase, where words are joined together and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized. For example, `firstName`, `totalAmount`, `userEmail`.

In our PostgreSQL databases, we use kebab_case for all table and column names, where words are separated by hyphens. For example, `order_items`, `user_email`. This naming convention helps to ensure consistency and clarity in our database design.

By adhering to these naming conventions, we can make our code more understandable and easier to maintain over time.

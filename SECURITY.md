## Overview
We are committed to maintaining the security of our software and protecting the privacy of our users. To encourage the identification and reporting of security vulnerabilities, we have established a Bug Bounty Program.

## Bug Bounty Program
If you discover a security vulnerability in our code, we invite you to report it through our Bug Bounty Program. By responsibly disclosing security issues, you help us improve our software and keep our users safe.

### Guidelines
To participate in our Bug Bounty Program, please follow these guidelines:

- **Responsible Disclosure:** Report vulnerabilities privately and give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.
- **No Unauthorized Access:** Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate its existence.
- **No Data Exposure:** Do not access, modify, or leak any sensitive user data or confidential information.
- **No Disruption:** Do not use the vulnerability to disrupt, degrade, or damage our services, systems, or networks.

### Reporting
To report a security vulnerability, please email us at [security@example.com] with the following information:

- A clear and concise description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue, including any relevant tools, scripts, or code
- Your name and contact information, if you would like to be acknowledged for your contribution

### Rewards
We offer financial rewards for qualifying vulnerability reports. The reward amount depends on the severity of the issue and the quality of the report. Our security team will evaluate each submission and determine the reward based on factors such as impact, exploitability, and report clarity.

Please note that we reserve the right to decide whether a vulnerability qualifies for a reward and to modify the Bug Bounty Program at any time.

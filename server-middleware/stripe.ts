  /*
  
  This example uses the express module to set up an HTTP server and handle requests to the /charge route. When a request is received, it extracts the credit card information from the request body and uses a payment processing service to charge the card. In a real-world application, you would need to use a real payment processing service, such as Stripe, to actually charge the credit card.

            The grammatical use of punctuation is fairly settled; punctuation style, on the other hand, is variable.
            <br>
            The Oxford comma is the final comma before the conjunction (and/or) in a series. For example, when I use an Oxford comma, my sentence might read, “Kalt makes the world better, cooler, and calmer". Without an Oxford comma, that sentence would read, “Kelly loves Twitter, yoga and blogging.”

          <p>
            Usually thought of as a way to communicate more effectively, abbreviations, in many cases, do the exact opposite. Abbreviations can confuse the recipient, therefore you ought to use the full  and alienate unfamiliar audiences, and even well-intentioned writers and speakers may overestimate an audience's familiarity with abbreviations
            <br>
            Whilst shortening long names are very effective, it can also cause unessacry misunderstandings,

              <li>PS Should always be abbreviated with only the first letters, capitalised. It should also always be at the end of a document. In order for it to be read by the audience, it ought to be written before a signature.</li>

          </h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to lists of dates that should be sortable or in chronological order — like a spreadsheet or system logs — you should use this format; yyyy.mm.dd. In texts you should you use the following format 30. September, 2021.

# Method
## Empowered decision-making
### Autonomy with Responsibility
At Kalt, we believe in the power of individual autonomy aligned with collective goals. Every team member has the freedom to make decisions independently throughout the week. These decisions, however, must resonate with our overarching company objectives, ensuring a unified direction towards our shared vision.

### Decision Scrutiny
While autonomy is encouraged, decisions are expected to stand up to scrutiny. They should be grounded in first principles and align with Kalt's long-term strategy, which is laid out in our three-year objectives.

## Strategic execution

### Dynamic Flexibility with Kanban
Kanban is central to our agile methodology, providing a visual workflow management system that enhances our team's flexibility and responsiveness. This approach allows us to visualize our work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency. By using Kanban, we ensure that our team can quickly adapt to changing priorities and respond to challenges in real-time, maintaining a steady flow of work without overburdening any team member.

### Strategic Direction with OKRs
Complementing our Kanban system are our Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). This framework helps us set clear, measurable goals that keep us focused on outcomes that matter. OKRs at Kalt are not just top-down; they involve every team member in setting ambitious yet achievable objectives. This alignment ensures that while our teams operate with agility and independence, their efforts are always contributing towards common, strategically aligned outcomes.

### Synchronized Agility and Focus
The combination of Kanban and OKRs empowers Kalt with a unique operational edge. On one hand, Kanban provides the agility needed in our fast-paced environment, allowing for a flexible and responsive approach to project management. On the other hand, OKRs anchor our efforts in a results-oriented framework, ensuring that every task, no matter how swiftly executed, is a step towards our strategic goals.

This blend of methodologies ensures that we stay agile enough to beat the huge comptetiors we are fighting against. Whilst remaining steadfastly focused on our long-term objectives. It's a balance of quick adaptability and unwavering strategic focus, enabling us to contineously exceed our ambitious targets.

## The Weekly Pulse
Our rhythm is set by a one-week cycle, starting with a Monday commitments meeting for task prioritization, and culminating in a Friday wins session to celebrate our achievements. This cycle keeps our team synchronized and focused on what matters most.

## Roadmap to Success
### Three-Year Horizon
Our journey is guided by a dynamic, rotating three-year roadmap. This roadmap serves as a living strategy document, encapsulating our long-term vision and ensuring all efforts are contributing towards these goals.

### Measuring Success
In our commitment to realism and adaptability, we regularly assess the likelihood of achieving our Key Results (KRs). This assessment is integral to our Monday commitments meeting, ensuring our goals remain achievable and aligned with our roadmap.

### Celebrating Progress
We cap off each week with a Friday wins meeting. This is where we take a moment to acknowledge our successes, fostering a culture of recognition and positivity. This meeting and the monday commitments are the only two meetings throughout the week.

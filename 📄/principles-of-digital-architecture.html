					<h2> A whitepaper on the principles of digital architecture. </h2>
					<p>
						Digital architecture is no different than software architecture, but the scope is much broader, and the principles more abstract. It does not favour one particular architectural paradigm over another, which means you do not have to choose a particular paradigm either. These principles can be applied to any paradigm - or a combination of pardigms - to allow teams, departments and entire organizations to create and iterate faster.
          </p>
					<p>
						We have all listened to talks by employees at Netflix about their architecture and thought "Everything should be event based microservices". But not all companies are made equal, not all companies are global streaming services, so naturally their technological solutions have to differ. This whitepaper leverages principles over paradigms. Taking inspiration from design systems, functional architecture, and organizational structures, to create a set of fundemental principles of digital architecture.

					<h2>Independent parts</h2>
					<p>
						The principle of decoupling interfaces from services, and services from services, and parts of code from parts of code, starts with decoupling logic from eachother. In a monolith, you should still be able to develop, upgrade and deploy the different parts independently. And each part should be resilient to the individual failures of any other part.
					</p>
					<p>
						Think of the "parts" as both <a href="#saas">SaaS solutions</a>, <a href="#microservices">serverless microservices</a>, low-code solutions, components, modules etc.
					</p>
				</div> <!-- End block -->
        <div class="block">
					<p>
						<strong>Resiliency:</strong>
						The only way the parts are in fact decoupled is if they do not depend on any of the other parts working at any one time. To achieve the desired level of resiliency, we create fall-backs, fail-overs, and other.
          </p>
					<p>
						<strong>Examples: </strong>
						<ul>
							<li>If you use Auth0 or Okta to allow users to authenticate on your site, and this third party is down, the users should still be able to browse the website and interact with it.</li>
							<li>If the warehouse management SaaS is down, users should still be able to place orders and check the latest status of it. This can be achieved by having redundant fulfillment services, that can queue messages to the warehouse management solution.</li>
							<li>If the payment service is not working properly, the cart in the store should ask for your email to save the cart for when the payment service is available again. </li>
							<li>You can take this principle to the extreme, and have styling for a specific page, live only on that specific page. This can be possible for smaller organizations and solutions, but can also be possible for larger ones. Finding and replacing an old brand-color in the sourcecode is not that hard.</li>

						<strong>Specialized software as a service</strong>
						Developing huge in-house solutions is a thing of the past, the overhead becomes immense.

						The business should only build what is required themselves, specialized SaaS solutions and

						<strong>Third party API's</strong>
						Certain logic does not even have to be a SaaS solution, but a simple third party API. For instance for checking the weather at a specific place, or the exchange rates. They should also be considered parts.

					<h2>Robust adapters</h2>
					<p>
						To achieve the independence between the parts, and allow of interopperatibility, the parts have to be able to speak to eachother. This can come in many forms, and will differ for each environment, from no-code integrations with Zappier to event driven microservices. But the fundemental principles stay the same. Each "adapter", should do little logic, it may convert a CSV format to a JSON API call, but you should be able to understand it in minutes, not hours. Logic should be left to the parts, the adapters allow the parts to talk to eachother.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Serverless</strong>
						Whenever possible, you should always opt for a serverless adapter, in most cases this will be the most resiliant solution.

					<h2>Interfaces</h2>
					<p>
						Interfaces should by all means necessarry be decoupled from the business logic, it should display data, and sometimes generate data. But it should not be where calculations are made. This goes in line with the emergence of static sites hosted on the edge, where you are able to serve up the pages, as close as possible to the user.
					</p>
					<p>
						This allows you to use multiple specialized SaaS solutions in combination for back office tasks, and switch them out more easily. While also letting you serve the entirity or partially the site from a content delivery network/the edge.
					</p>
					<p>
						This does not mean that the sites are entirely static, this simply means whatever can be rendered server-side, should be. Dynamic content is still incredibly relevant, but the entire site should not be generated client-side. Walmart saw a 1% incremental increase in revenue from a 100ms faster loading speed.

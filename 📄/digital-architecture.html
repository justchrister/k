					<h2> Introduction </h2>
					<p>
						Digital architecture is no different than software architecture, but the scope is much broader. Digital architecture does favour one particular architectural paradigm over another, therefore it does not dictate that you need to choose a particular paradigm either. Digital architecture aims to be a set of principles that you can apply to any paradigm - or a combination of pardigms - to allow teams, departments and entire organizations to create, iterate, and evolve, faster.
          </p>

					<p>
						We have all listened to talks by employees at Netflix about their architecture and thought "Everything should be event based microservices" in awe. But not all companies are made the same, not all companies are global streaming services, and therefore their technological solutions have to differ. This whitepaper leverages principles over paradigms, taking key elements from clean architecture and try to apply them to an entire business.

					<h2>Independent parts</h2>
					<p>
						The principle of decoupling interfaces from services, and services from services, and parts of code from parts of code, is what we mean here. It does not simply mean that you should "not build a monolith", but that when you are building components or microservices, they should be not be coupled to eachother.
					</p>
					<p>
						Think of the "parts" as both SaaS solutions, microservices, low-code solutions, components, modules etc.
					</p>
				</div> <!-- End block -->
        <div class="block">
					<p>
						<strong>Resiliency:</strong>
						The only way the parts are in fact decoupled is if they do not depend on any of the other parts working at any one time. To achieve the desired level of resiliency, we create fall-backs, fail-overs, and other.
          </p>
					<p>
						<strong>Examples: </strong>
						<ul>
							<li>If you use Auth0 or Okta to allow users to authenticate on your site, and this third party is down, the users should still be able to browse the website and interact with it.</li>
							<li>If the warehouse management SaaS is down, users should still be able to place orders and check the latest status of it. This can be achieved by having redundant fulfillment services, that can queue messages to the warehouse management solution.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
        </div> <!-- End block -->
        <div class="block">
					<p>
						<strong>Extreme:</strong>
						You can take this principle to the extreme, and have styling for a specific page, live only on that specific page. This can be possible for smaller organizations and solutions, but can also be possible for larger ones. Finding and replacing an old brand-color in the sourcecode is not that hard.

					<h2>Interfaces</h2>
					<p>
						Interfaces should by all means necessarry be decoupled from the business logic, it should display data, and sometimes generate data. But it should not be where calculations are made. This goes in line with the emergence of static sites hosted on the edge, where you are able to serve up the pages, as close as possible to the user.
					</p>
					<p>
						This allows you to use multiple specialized SaaS solutions in combination for back office tasks, and switch them out more easily. While also letting you serve the entirity or partially the site from a content delivery network/the edge.
					</p>
					<p>
						This does not mean that the sites are entirely static, this simply means whatever can be rendered server-side, should be. Dynamic content is still incredibly relevant, but the entire site should not be generated client-side. Walmart saw a 1% incremental increase in revenue from a 100ms faster loading speed.

						The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.</br>

						Digital architecture is no different than software architecture, but the scope is much broader. The goal is to make systems and processes that empower entire organizations to quickly create, iterate, and evolve. This requires the technological solutions to be soft, maluable and diverse. The marketing department should never be limited by the CMS the company chose. With good design systems, software architecture and serverless infrastructure, we can empower the business to do what they do best.

					<p>
						The future will inevitably be something along the lines of static interfaces, with dynamic functionlity, integrated with specilized SaaS solutions, thirdparty APIs all powered by an eventdriven serverless microservice architecture.

						Technologists have long tried to push everything into codebases and take complete control over the business. The future has something else in mind, and therefore the IT department must evolve, and become more versatile.

						Hosted on the edge, and dynamic content being delivered through API's.
					</p>
					<p>
						This does not mean that the sites are entirely static, this simply means whatever can be rendered server-side, should be. Dynamic content is still incredibly relevant, but the entire site should not be generated client-side. Walmart saw a 1% incremental increase in revenue from a 100ms faster loading speed.

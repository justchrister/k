					<!--<h2>Foundational guiding values and principles</h2>-->
					<p>
						We strive to be politically agnostic, and make objective decisions based on facts derrived from data. No grandstanding.
					</p>

      <div class="section">

					<h2>Core values</h2>
	        <p>
	          <strong>Integrity</strong>
						Decisions guided by strong moral principles can achieve a higher level of trust between parties, mostly because the outcomes are highly predictable. Simply put, it is making the honest, fair, and smart decision, over the easy one. Short term this might result in monetary loss, but over time the result is definitely higher value.
	        </p>
					<p>
						<strong>Transparency</strong>
						We are proactively open and honest, even though we are thoughtful and responsible with the insights we share, there is no little diffrence between internal discussions, and public statements. We have a commitment to having no hidden agenda, and to be open and honest internally and with the public.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Productive</strong>
						By constantly collaborating within our team, and with other corporations, organizations, and instiutions we can achieve much more. We create effective processes to tackle challenges without delay to deliver innovation that matters.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Inclusive</strong>
						When our differences are embraced and respected help us develop better solutions that benefit everyone, rather than some. Being met with differences in opinion and background increases innovation and help us, as individuals, and as an organiation to get out of our bubble to drive better performance and to create a world where everyone can be themselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Accountability</strong>
						Everyone should take their responsibilty for their actions and decisions, as well as
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Independence</strong>
						We believe people should be in charge of their fate,
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Equal opportunities</strong>
						We believe people should be in charge of their fate,
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Aesthetics</strong>
						The world should not just be productive, it should be pretty and cute as well.
					</p>

					<h2>Guiding principles</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Individual Rights</strong>
						We are each created with equal individual rights to control and to defend our life, liberty and property and to voluntary contractual exchange.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>A lean government</strong>
						Governments main objective ought to be to secure individual rights. Moreover, government ought to nurture and encourage its citizens through incentives, rather than disincentives in the form of taxes and bureaucratic red tape.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Equal justice</strong>
						Government must treat everyone equally; neither rewarding failure nor punishing success.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Subsidiarity</strong>
						Government authority must reside at the lowest feasible level.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Spontaneous Order</strong>
						When individual rights are respected, unregulated competition will maximize economic benefit for society by providing the most goods and services possible at the lowest cost.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Freedom</strong>
						Freedom of thought, worship, speech, and association are all essential to create an innovative, inclusive, and effective population.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The Golden Rule</strong>
						Deal with others honestly and require honesty in return.

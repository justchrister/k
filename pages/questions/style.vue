            Why do we need inflation?
          </h1>
		  <p>
			  Inflation is good when it combats the effects of deflation, which is often worse for an economy. When consumers expect prices to rise, they spend now, boosting economic growth. An important aspect of keeping a good inflation rate is managing expectations of future inflation.

      <h2> The thesis </h2>
      <p>Art is not just an emotional investment, it's a financial one too. Pieces by iconic artists like Monet or Picasso are rare, adding a built-in value that stands the test of time. In an era where wealth is growing for the affluent, their appetite for tangible and meaningful assets like art is becoming increasingly clear.</p>
      <p>Art offers something unique: it's not only a financial asset but also a status symbol and a source of emotional enrichment. The growing demand from wealthy investors is a key factor that's likely to push the value of art even higher.</p>
      <p>Including art in your investment portfolio is not just a wise choice, but a forward-thinking strategy. Unlike traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds, art adds a dimension of tangible ownership and emotional engagement that's unmatched.</p>
      <p>By investing in the art fund you can own a piece of all the artworks in our portfolio, and enjoy the benefits of a diversified portfolio of art.</p>

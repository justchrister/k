          <p> We build both smaller sites in villages and huge industrial scale sites, close to cities or industrial areas. This supercharges the transition to fossil free energy everywhere, not just in cities. This also makes the electrical grids more resilient and stable. </p>

          <p> So that you dont just invest in a single solar panel, rather you buy shares in the fund that owns all the solar panels all over the world. Decreased risk for both us and you. </p>

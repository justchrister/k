      <h1> Introduction </h1>
      <p> 
        The only way to have actual lasting impact is to use market forces to drive a change. The issues we are facing require a lot of funding, and the only way to allocate the adequate capital, is if that capital actually gives a return on investment.
      </p>
      <p> 
        To guide us towards this improved future, we work in a methodical and structured way. We have defined three goals that we believe are the most important to achieve our shared mission and broader vision for a more sustainable future.

      <strong> Goal 01 </strong>
      <h2> 2x market returns </h2>
      <p>

      <strong> Goal 02 </strong>
      <h2> Impact that grows </h2>
      <p>
        The positive environmental and societal impact has to grow over time. The true measure of an investment lies not just in its financial returns but in its capacity to effect positive change. Our approach is to enhance the impact of every dollar, euro or yen invested. Planting seeds, not just harvesting returns.

      <strong> Goal 03 </strong>
      <h2> Make it transparent </h2>
      <p>
        Transparency is fundamental when making huge promises. It is vital that you both see and understand the impact of your investments. Our commitment is to provide comprehensive and clear updates that details both financial performance and the real-world impact. 
      </p>
      <p>

      <h2> Product development principles </h2>
    </block>
    <block margin="half">
      <strong>Build for people</strong>
      <p>
        Both our customer facing solution, such as this website, but also the infrastructure we are creating globally, needs to be built for the people actually living there.
      </p>
    </block>
    <block margin="half">
      <strong>Agressively optimistic</strong>
      <p>
        Creating Kalt won't be a walk in the park; it demands years of dedication and innovation. We are driven by our mission and determined to stay optimistic, even when faced with immense challenges.
      </p>
    </block>
    <block margin="half">
      <strong>Equal opportunity</strong>
      <p>
        We believe that everyone should have access to this kind of investment opportunity. You should not have to be a millionaire to invest in fossil-free energy, and you can feel good knowing that your money is making a difference for families in developing regions, for the environment, and generating you a passive income.
      </p>
    </block>
    <block margin="half">
      <strong>Simple first, then powerful</strong>
      <p>
        Focus on simplicity in functionality before adding a bunch of shiny features that might not accomplish much. Skip the nonesense and jargon.
      </p>
    </block>
    <block margin="half">
      <strong>Maximize impact</strong>
      <p>
        Impact and wealth creation are not in opposition, they should work together, where wealth creation creates more impact and vice versa.
      </p>
    </block>
    <block>
      <strong>Aim for clarity</strong>
      <p>
        Everyone should understand what they are investing in, the risks, and how its contributing to the wealth creation.

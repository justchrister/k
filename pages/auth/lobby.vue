      <p>As I sat in the dentist's lobby, the silence was almost deafening. I couldn't shake the feeling of anxiousness as I stared at my phone, willing the e-mail verification to appear. Time seemed to crawl by as I waited, and I couldn't help but feel like I was trapped in some sort of purgatory. The only sound in the room was the occasional typing of the receptionist, a constant reminder of the passing time. I tried to distract myself, but it was no use. The e-mail was all I could think about. And then, finally, it arrived. The notification lit up my screen, and I let out a sigh of relief. The waiting was over, and I could finally escape this hellish limbo.<br> â€” Hemmingway, GPT-3</p>-->

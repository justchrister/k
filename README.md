The site leverages clamp(MIN, VAL, MAX) in order to be auto-responsive, where you create one design to fit every single screen. While this has its limitations, the limitations have an advantage: Good design, all the time. It requires some abstract thinking around the design, however, with the proper testing, you can achieve a beatiful design that works on all surfaces, for all users.



### Framework
Components
- Data only flows down
- 

## Coding principles
- 100ms rule; Everything you do has to be completed in 100ms
- 150px rule; the website should scale perfectly from 150px to 150 000px. 
- Do more, do better

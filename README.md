# Kalt â€” Front-end

Kalt is a startup building a vertically integrated fossil-free energy generator and exchange that lets anyone invest directly in fossil free energy generation, and earn direct dividends from it. 

## Design

The site leverages clamp(MIN, VAL, MAX) in order to be auto-responsive, where you create one design to fit every single screen. While this has its limitations, the limitations can be used to your advantage. It requires some abstract thinking around the design, however, with the proper testing, you can achieve a beatiful design that works on all surfaces, for all users.

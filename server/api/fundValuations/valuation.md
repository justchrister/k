# Trailing average forecasting
this is a very simplified approach to valuation. By no means an adequate solution, but a useful starting point, a more detailed financial analysis will be necessary in the near term future. 

1. 90 day average, multiplied by 365
2. -4% operating cost
3. +2% inflation
4. -x% discount rate (see desc below)
5. +x% premium rate (see desc below

## discount rate
Market risk, the specific industry risk, and any company-specific risks

## premium rate
Legislation promoting renewable energy, increased demand, etc

## risks not accounted for explicitly
However, are accounted for to some extent in the discount rate
1. seasonality
2. inflation - its static
3. aging equipment,
4. environmental damages (flooding)
5. political turmoil (wars)
6. anticipated competition


## future improvements may include
1. detailed cash flow projections
2. thorough geographical risk assessments
3. using multiple valuation methods for comparison

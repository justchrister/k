## Trailing average forecasting
Extremely simplictic calculation of the forecasted income. By no means an adequate solution, but the one we have in place for now.

1. 90 day average, multiplied by 365
2. -4% operating cost
3. +2% inflation
4. -x% discount rate (see calc below)
5. +x% premium rate (see calc below

### discount rate
Market risk, the specific industry risk, and any company-specific risks

### premium rate
Legislation promoting renewable energy, increased demand, etc

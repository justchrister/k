  For far too long now we've expected issues to get
resolved simply, by letting time go by — time heals
all wounds — turns out, not all issues can be solved
simply by waiting for a solution to occur.
  Sometimes, i'd even dare to say most times, we have
to take swift and drastic action in order to ensure
the worst outcome becomes the least likely.
  Currently, the worst outcome is becoming a reality,
the oceans are dying, birds are shrinking, people are
starving, yet, we are debating whether or not we
should let a sexist host a gameshow.

What a waste.

  By no means am i saying we ought to let sexists and
homophobic people take to public arenas and get
filthy rich. BUT, clearly that is not as important as
climate change. Some will try to argue that they are
seperate issues, and that you can spend energy on both.
Those peopleclearly have never achieved anything. It
requires laser focus to solve issues as grand as the
ones we have, and to alianate half the voter base
because they have weird oppinions about muslims, is
stupid.

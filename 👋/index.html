					<h1> About </h1>
          <p>
						This is a think tank — that is practical, rather than theoretical — with the goal of making everywhere more inclusive and interesting. Through local change, with a global perspective.

						<strong>Events/exhibtions</strong> Our goal is to find interesting and one of a kind curators that can put together unique experiences with up and coming artists.
					</p>
        <div class="block">

					<p>
						<strong>Art</strong> Artists are one of the few that are able to bring up taboo topic, set the agenda for public discussion, and amplify important voices.

						<strong>Capital</strong> Our enourmous goals are capital intensive, and require us to earn money continously. However, profits is a means to an end, and an outcome of doing extraordinary work.

        <div class="block">
				</div>
					<p>
						<strong>Nomadic</strong> Our team is located everywhere, and we have no headquarters or physical location. This lets us find the perfect venue for an event, and work with artists from anywhere.

# How does Kalt work, and what happens when I invest?

We build small and big fossil-free energy sites all over the world. Close to cities, industrial areas, and even around small villages. 

This means more people have equal access to clean energy. Not just cities in reach countries. 

Then we add all those sites to a big pool of sites (just like an index fund does with stocks), so when you invest, you buy shares of the index instead of a single solar panel. That means your risk is substanitally lower, since an earthquake or bad weather wont effect your investment.

We are always selling energy, so you are always making money. If you own 10% of all shares, you get 10% of the income of the entire index. 

Even better, you can feel good knowing your money is making a difference for families in developing regions, for the environment, and generating you a passive income.

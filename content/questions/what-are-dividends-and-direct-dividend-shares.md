# What are dividends and direct dividend shares?

Dividends are a way for us to pay you money when we earn money, the direct part in the direct dividend share name is the fact that we pay you on a daily basis, while dividends are traditionally paid out on a yearly or quarterly basis. Investing through our platform is therefore both good for the environment, but it is a great way to earn a consistent income. 

With direct dividend shares we offers an investment opportunity in a diverse pool of fossil-free energy assets, located all around the world. And the best part is of course, the daily payments of dividends. These dividends are a share of the profits generated by the assets and it's like getting paid every day for owning a small piece of those assets. It's a great way to earn a return on your investment and have a steady income stream. 

A smart move for anyone looking to secure their financial future.

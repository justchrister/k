# How does direct dividend funds work? 

When you invest through Kalt, you are effectively buying a small piece of ownership in each of the fossil-free energy sites or artworks we own. This investment strategy allows you to diversify your portfolio and gain exposure to a wide range of fossil-free energy production sites, affordable housing units, small businesses and so much more, located all around the world.

This way, you are not putting all your eggs in one basket and reducing the risk of your investment. 

Additionally, by investing through our funds, you can also expect a steady stream of residual income, as the energy generated, art sold and homes built by us, will continually generate revenue for you as an investor.

# how does direct dividend funds work? 

When you purchase shares in an index of renewable energy assets, you are effectively buying a small piece of ownership in each of the renewable energy production assets included in the index. This investment strategy allows you to diversify your portfolio and gain exposure to a wide range of renewable energy production assets, located all around the world.


This way, you are not putting all your eggs in one basket and reducing the risk of your investment. The value of an index of renewable energy assets is determined by the performance of the individual assets included in the index, such as the amount of energy generated, the level of maintenance required, and the regulatory environment in the location of the site.


Additionally, by investing in an index of renewable energy assets, you can also expect a steady stream of residual income, as the energy generated by the assets is sold to utilities and other buyers, generating revenue for you as an investor.

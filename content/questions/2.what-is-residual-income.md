Residual income is money that keeps coming in even after you've done the initial work. Investing in solar energy is a great way to get some of that sweet residual income. By investing in a solar energy project, you can earn money from the electricity it generates. And the best part? This income keeps coming in for years, giving you a long-term and predictable stream of cash flow.
